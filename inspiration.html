    <h1>Inspiration</h1>

    <h2>Drawing Wiff Waffles</h2>
    <p>Drawing Wiff Waffles has been a big inspiratin to me ever since I started watching youtube. Rin takes on
        obstacles and challenges to show how art can be whatever you want it too. She turns mistakes into something that
        makes the piece better and ends up with amazing illustrations no matter how big the challenge. Her youtube
        account currently has 2.55 million followers and over 370 million views in total.</p>

    <h2>Padeliciouss</h2>
    <p>Pedro has a really smooth and aestheticly pleasing art style that really works with the characters they draw.
        Pedro draws a lot of characters that I find myself drawing as well, in interesting poses and styles. They are a
        digital
        artist which is what I am aiming to get better at.</p>

        they draw amazing backgrounds tha really give the character a sense of space. </p>

        together and it works really well. Loish uses colors extremly well to make some things faded other things stand
        out. She currently has 2.4 million followers on instagram.</p>

    <h2>j.drw</h2>
    <p>Jack creates really iteresting sketches by using lines and hatching to create shading. He really understands the
        planes of the face and acurately captures how people look. I aspire to be able to use pencil in this unique
        geometrical way. </p>
